<h5>Encryption</h5>
<p>You may consider to use the application to auto-fill passwords with your fingerprint. Be aware that this is not a high-security application and encryption or data-breach flaws can happen. However, all sensible data that is stored in this application, especially the key commands you have created, is encrypted with industry standard AES encryption where the password for this encryption is randomly and unique generated for each command, fingerprint and device. This is also the reason why you cannot read the saved commands without your fingerprint, after you have stored them.</p>

<h5>Attention</h5>
<p>This tool does use AES encryption to encrypt data on your desktop with your unique mobile device fingerprint. If you decide to save passwords make always sure that you remember/save this passwords somewhere else. If you change your fingerprint you never have access again to this encrypted entries.</p>
