<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>Hi ladies and gents. This is Roland Eigelsreiter aka Brain Foo Long. I hope you enjoy this testballoon. I've created this application because i ever wanted to control something on my desktop with my mobile devices fingerprint authentication. I personally use this to unlock some of my password protected areas on my desktop because i use really long passwords and it bother me everytime i need to enter these. However, you've accepted the disclaimer, use this application at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>This desktop application and your other device must be connected to the same network and must be able to see each other. The best case is that the ip address for your desktop computer doesn't change. The other device will use this ip address to connect to the desktop application.</p>
